   ## Context
A few weeks ago, seven of my friends and I went to a video game development competition. Each of us being low-level programmers, we tried to create a concept that would be out of the ordinary to overcome our lack of knowledge in modeling. Here is the result after forty hours of hard work.

> The theme determines the environment around which we have to develop our game. In the case of the Valleyfield competition, the theme was **an hostel**.

## Goal

You are an innkeeper's employee who has to fetch beer from the inn's cellar, which is actually a `procedurally generated labyrinth`.

It is very dark in the cellar, which makes the experience more stressful and adds a new difficulty when you want to bring back the beer to your employer.

You will be equipped with a `hand torch`, which will allow you to see around you. Some ignitable wall torches will also be available on the walls of the cellar, allowing you to find your way back to the hostel to bring back the crates.

The death system of the player works with the torch, which go out gradually until you return to the hostel or find a campfire in the basement to rekindle it. You can see the intensity level of the flame at the `top left` of your screen. After the torch has died, you have ten seconds to find a way to revive it. If the torch is still dead after those ten seconds, you are teleported back to the inn.

Also, at the top left of your screen, you will notice that there are `4 bottles`. Every time you find a crate in the basement, a bottle will turn `green`, which means that you have a crate of beer on you, but it still has to be reported to the innkeeper. Once that's done, the beer will turn `blue`, meaning that it has been delivered.

> If you die, you will lose all the beers which has not been yet delivered.

Once you have brought the 4 crates of beer on time to the innkeeper, you will receive congratulations from him.
